<!-- Title : Depok Defense -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  The Chanek Nation can be represented in the cartesian plane. Chanek's Electricity Company (CEC) is located at $(0, 0)$. The cities in Chanek Nation
  is located in each $(i, j)$ for all $1 \le i \le 10 \, 000$ and $1 \le j \le 10\,000$.
</p>

<p>
  Chanek Nation is currently experiencing total infrastructure failure. There are $N$
  important regions that needs electricity as fast as possible. A region is marked with
  $x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$, meaning the region contains all cities $(i, j)$ such that
  $x_1 \le i \le x_2$ and $y_1 \le j \le y_2$. 
</p>

<p>
  CEC can run backup electricity to city $(i, j)$ if there are no other cities in the straight line between $(0, 0)$ and $(i, j)$. Now, Pak Chanek wonders
  how many cities in the important region that can have backup electricity.
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p>
  The first line consists of an integer $T$ — the number of test cases. Each test case will be stated as follows.
</p>

<p>
  The first line contains $N$ integers — the number of important regions.
</p>

<p>
  The next $N$ lines consists of $4$ integers $x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$, representing an important region.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p>
For each test case, output the number of cities in the important region that gets backup electricity.
</p>
