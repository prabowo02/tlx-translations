<!-- Title : Measuring Territories -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
    Pak Chanek just arrived in an uninhabited island. This island is an $N \times M$
    rectangle. The top left corner is square $(1, 1)$ and the bottom right corner is 
    square $(N, M)$.
</p>

<p>
    Because it is an uninhabited island, Pak Chanek wants to develop territories on that
    island. At first, Pak Chanek has no territories in that island.
</p>

<p>
    Pak Chanek will then perform $Q$ operations of three types, which are:
    <ul>
        <li>Operation type $1$, Pak Chanek will develop a territory on all squares that are located on
            row $X$. It is guaranteed that there weren't any type $1$ operation in 
            row $X$ before.
        </li>
        <li>Operation type $2$, Pak Chanek will develop a territory on all squares that are located on
            column $X$. It is guaranteed that there weren't any type $2$ operation in 
            column $X$ before.
        </li>
        <li>Operation type $3$, Pak Chanek will give two coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$. 
            Calculate how many squares that are Pak Chanek's territory within the rectangular area
            formed by the square $(x_1, y_1)$ and square $(x_2, y_2)$.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Help Pak Chanek answer every type $3$ operation!
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p>The first line contains an integer $T$ — the number of test cases.
   Each test case is stated as follows.
</p>

<p>
  The first line consists of three integers $N$, $M$, $Q$ — the size of
  the island and the number of Pak Chanek's questions respectively.
</p>

<p>
  The next $Q$ lines will be of the following format:
  <ul>
      <li>If the line is of operation type $1$, it will contain two integers $A$ and $X$.
          It is guaranteed that $A = 1$.
      </li>
      <li>If the line is of operation type $2$, it will contain two integers $A$ and $X$.
        It is guaranteed that $A = 2$.
    </li>
    <li>If the line is of operation type $3$, it will contain five integers $A$, $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$, and $y_2$.
        It is guaranteed that $A = 3$.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p>
    For each operation type $3$, output an integer representing
    the answer of operation type $3$.
