<!-- Title : Chanek's Mystery -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  Pak Chanek is a spy. He is currently sneaking into Ferguso's base. He found a document 
  labelled  "TOP SECRET" containing Ferguso's secret message.
</p>

<p>
  Ferguso's message consists of $N$ distinct words. The $i$-th word in the message is $S_i$. There is also a matrix
  $M$ of size $N \times N$, which is the "distance requirement" of the message.
</p>

<p>
  $M_{i, j}$ is defined as follows:
  <ul>
      <li>For $i = j$, then $M_{i, j} = 0$.</li>
      <li>For $|i - j| = 1$, then $M_{i, j}$ is the number of positions such that the characters in $S_i$ and $S_j$ 
          are different, added by the length difference of the two words. For example, the distance between "balon"
          and "galon" is $1$ and the distance between "bcd" and "abcd" is $4$. 
      </li>
      <li>For $|i - j| > 1$, if $i < j$, then 
          $M_{i, j} = M_{i, i + 1} + M_{i + 1, i + 2} + \dots + M_{j - 2, j - 1} + M_{j - 1, j}$.
          If $i > j$, then $M_{i, j} = M_{j, i}$. 
      </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Ferguso is a cunning individual. After reading the secret message that satisfies the condition above, Ferguso will
  shuffle around the positions of the words in $S$ and build a new matrix. The new message and matrix will be called
  $S'$ and $M'$ respectively. Define $P_k$ as the original position of the $k$-th character in $S'$. 
  Thus, $M'_{i, j} = M_{P_i, P_j}$ for all $1 \le i, j \le N$. 
</p>

<p>
  Pak Chanek is now puzzles as the document he found contains $S'$ and $M'$. Help Pak Chanek find the original message
  or determine if that document is a false lead. A document is said to be a false lead if there are no permutations
  of $S'$ that satisfies the three conditions above.
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p>
  The first line consists of an integer $N$ — the number of words in the document found by Pak Chanek.
</p>

<p>
  The next line contains $N$ strings — the words in the shuffled message, or $S'$.
</p>

<p>
  The next $N$ lines each consists of $N$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $M'_{i, j}$.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p>
  There are two possible outputs:
  <ul>
      <li>If there is a permutation of the shuffled words that satisfied the three conditions given, output
          that permutation which each word seperated by a space. If there are multiple solutions, output any.
      </li>
      <li>If there are no solutions, output "Aku sudah menyangka tidak akan semudah ini Ferguso" (meaning 
          "I expected it wouldn't be this easy, Ferguso." in Indonesian) without quotes.
      </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p>
    Calculating distance between "di" and "adalah" in $S$:
    <ul>
        <li>$M_{2, 3} = 5$. Distance between "di" and "bulan"</li>
        <li>$M_{3, 4} = 6$. Distance between "bulan" and "adalah"</li>
    </ul>
    Thus, $M_{2, 4} = 5 + 6 = 11$.
</p>

<p>
    In $S'$, "di" is in the $8$th position and "adalah" is in the $2$nd position. Hence,
    $P_8 = 2$ and $P_2 = 4$. Thus, $M'_{8, 2} = 11$. 
</p>

<p>
  It can be shown that the $S$ above satisfies all other conditions of the matrix.
</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
    <li>$1 \le N \le 1\,000$</li>
    <li>Each word is unique, consists of only the characters 'a' to 'z', and the 
        length of the word is at most $1\,000$.
    </li>
    <li>$0 \le M_{i, j} \le 1 \, 000 \, 000$</li>
</ul>
