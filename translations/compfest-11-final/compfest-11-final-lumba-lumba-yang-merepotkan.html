<!-- Title : Troublesome Dolphins -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  Pak Chanek is a dolphin handler in Taman Safari Bogor (Bogor Zoo). One day, Pak Chanek's dolphins wants to 
  eat the special fishes available only in Danau Kenanga (Kenanga River), UI. This request was asked right at 
  the time when there was a special discount for purchasing said fishes.
</p>

<p>
  Danau Kenanga has been divided into $N \times M$ sectors. The sector at the $i$-th row ($1 \le i \le N$) and
  the $j$-th column ($1 \le j \le M$) is called Sector-$(i, j)$. Sector-$(1, 1)$ is located at the top-left corner
  and Sector-$(N, M)$ is located at the bottom-rigth corner. Sector-$(i, j)$ has $A_{i, j}$ fishes in it. To keep
  the quality of fish as evenly distributed as possible, Pak Chanek will select a rectangular area and purchase
  all the fish in that area.
</p>

<p>
  UI has infinitely many trucks that can be used for delivering the fish. Each truck has a maximum capacity of
  $K$ fishes. As it is a long distance delivery, UI enforces a delivery to utilize at least $2$ trucks. Note that
  each truck must not be empty and there must be at most $1$ truck not at full capacity. Truck fees can be very
  expensive. Thus, Pak Chanek wants to minimize <b>the number of trucks used</b>. It doesn't matter anyways as the fish
  will be sliced and diced once it has reached the zoo. Help Pak Chanek select a rectangular area such that the
  shipment can be fulfilled!
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p>
  The first line consists of three integers $N$, $M$, and $K$ — the number of rows, the number of columns, and
  the maximum capacity of a truck. 
</p>
<p>
  The next $N$ lines consists of $M$ integers $A_{i, j}$, where the $j$-th integer in the $i$-th row ($1 \le j 
  \le M$ and $1 \le i \le N$) denoted the number of fishes in Sector-$(i, j)$.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p>
  In the first line, output an integer — the minimum number of trucks required by Pak Chanek.
</p>

<p>
  In the second line, output four integers $r_1$, $c_1$, $r_2$, and $c_2$ ($1 \le r_1 \le r_2 \le N$,
  $1 \le c_1 \le c_2 \le M$). $(r_1, c_1)$ is the top-left corner of the rectangular area and $(r_2, c_2)$
  is the bottom-right corner selected by Pak Chanek. It is guaranteed there is a rectangular area that allows
  a delivery. If there are multiple areas that fulfill the requirement, output any.
</p>


<h3>Sample Input</h3>

<pre>
3 4 5
4 4 3 1
4 1 1 4
11 2 3 2
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>

<pre>
2
1 2 2 3
</pre>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p>
    The area selected by Pak Chanek:
    <pre>
    4 3
    1 1
    </pre>
    The total number of fish acquired would be $4 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 9$.
    <br/>
    As such, the delivery will use $2$ trucks, $5$ fishes will be placed into the first truck and $4$ fishes
    will be placed into the second truck.
</p>

<p>
    There are other areas that satisfy the requirements. For example, <code>1 2 1 3</code> and 
    <code>2 2 3 3</code>.
