<!-- Title : Mad Rat Disease -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
    Pak Chanek has a field that is $1000 \times 1000$ squares wide. Currently, there is a 
    mad rat disease plague and it is predicted that they will attack Pak Chanek's field tomorrow.
    There are at most $N$ mad rats. The $i$-th mad rat has a $50\%$ chance of attacking
    square $(X_i, Y_i)$. The $i$-th mad rat could only attack square $(X_i, Y_i)$. 
</p>

<p>
    Pak Chanek asks help from his friend, Luffy, to face the mad rats. The mad rats will only
    appear together at some time. When the mad rats appear, Luffy will shape his hand to form 
    <b>the smallest rectangle</b> that can hit all the rats at once. However, not all mad rats
    that are recorded will appear. It is possible that only a couple of them shows up to attack
    Pak Chanek's field. Obviously, Luffy will adapt the shape of his hand according to which
    rats are attacking.
</p>

<p>
    Because there are many different possibilities of rats attacking, determine the 
    <b>expected value</b> of the area that Luffy's hand will be shaped into to hit all the rats. 
    It can be shown that the <b>expected value</b> can always be represented in $\frac{P}{Q}$ such 
    that $P$ and $Q$ are integers and $\text{GCD}(P, Q) = 1$. 
    As such, output $(P \times Q^{-1}) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007$.
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p>The first line contains an integer $T$ — the number of test cases.</p>

<p>
For each test case: <br>
<ul>
    <li>The first line consists of an integer $N$ — the maximum 
        number of mad rats that could appear</li>
    <li>The next $N$ lines each contains two integers $X_i$ and $Y_i$ — 
        the square that will be attacked by the $i$-th mad rat if it
        appears.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p>
    Output an integer, the result of $(P \times Q^{-1}) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007$,
    with $\frac{P}{Q}$ being the <em>expected value</em> of the area of Luffy's
    hand and $A^{-1} \bmod B$ is the inverse of $A$ in $\bmod B$.

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p>
There are 8 different possible mad rat appearances:
<ul>
    <li>No rats appear, Luffy's hand area is $0$.</li>
    <li>The rats appear only in square $(1, 1)$, 
        Luffy's hand area is $1$.</li>
    <li>The rats appear only in square $(2, 3)$,
        Luffy's hand area is $1$.
    </li>
    <li>The rats appear only in square $(1, 5)$,
        Luffy's hand area is $1$.
    </li>
    <li>
        The rats appear in squares $(1, 1)$ and $(2, 3)$,
        Luffy's hand area is $6$.
    </li>
    <li>
        The rats appear in squares $(1, 1)$ and $(1, 5)$,
        Luffy's hand area is $5$.
    </li>
    <li>
        The rats appear in squares $(2, 3)$ and $(1, 5)$,
        Luffy's hand area is $6$.
    </li>
    <li>
        The rats appear in squares $(1, 1)$, $(1, 5)$, and $(2, 3)$,
        Luffy's hand area is $10$.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
    Because each event has the same probability of happening, the 
    <em>expected value</em> is $\frac{0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 10}{8} = \frac{15}{4}$.
    The output should thus be $(15 \times 4^{-1}) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007 = 750\,000\,009$.
