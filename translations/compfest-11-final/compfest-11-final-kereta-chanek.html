<!-- Title : Chanek Trains -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  Pak Chanek is the owner of the Chanek Trains corporation. A Chanek Train is represented as a string of length $N$
  consisting of either seats or doors at each point. If the $i$-th character is $0$, then the $i$-th position is a door.
  Otherwise if the $i$-th character is $1$, then the $i$-th position is a seat.
</p>

<p>
  Pak Chanek now wants to place the passengers inside his train. Each passenger must sit in exactly one seat and each seat
  can only be sit on by at most one passenger. The time required for a passenger to move from the $i$-th position to the
  $j$-th position is $|i - j|$ second(s). At each second, a door can serve at most one passenger. Passengers are already
  in front of all the doors at the $0$-th second.
</p>

<p>
  Pak Chanek now wonders, what is the minimum time required in seconds such that all seats in Pak Chanek's train is taken
  if we assume there are infinitely many passengers waiting in front of each door.
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p>
  The first line consists of an integer $N$ — the length of the Chanek Train.
</p>
<p>
  The second line consists of $N$ characters $A_i$ — the configuration of the Chanek Train.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p>
  Output a single integer, the minimum time required in seconds.

<h3>Explanation</h3> 
<!-- As of the writing of this translation, the original image is not available.-->

<p>
    For the first sample, the following sequence of evens would result in minimum time:
    <ul>
        <li>At second $0$, passenger $1$ is at position $3$</li>
        <li>At second $1$, passenger $1$ moves to position $4$, passenger $2$ is at position $3$</li>
        <li>At second $2$, passenger $1$ moves to position $5$ and sits there, passenger $2$ moves to position $4$ and sits there.
             Passenger $3$ is at position $3$.
        </li>
        <li>At second $3$, passenger $3$ moves to position $2$, passenger $4$ is at position $3$</li>
        <li>At second $4$, passenger $3$ moves to position $1$ and sits there, passenger $4$ moves to position $3$ and sits there</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    All seats have been filled in 4 seconds, the minimum time. It can be proven that there is no sequence of events
    that results in a lower resulting time.
