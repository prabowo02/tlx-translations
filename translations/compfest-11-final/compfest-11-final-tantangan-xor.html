<!-- Title : XOR Challenge -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  Pak Chanek is teaching Chaneka the <b>bitwise</b> XOR ($\oplus$) operation for integers.
</p>

<p>
  Now, Pak Chanek gives a challenge to Chaneka. Pak Chanek has an array $A$ of size $N$, indexed
  from $1$ to $N$. At first, all elements in that array is $0$ (empty). Pak Chanek will then perform $Q$
  operations $u_i$ $v_i$ $x_i$, for $1 \le i \le Q$, consecutively on that array. The operation
  $u_i$ $v_i$ $x_i$ is defined is modifying the value of $A[u_i]$ to $A[u_i] \oplus x_i$ and
  $A[v_i]$ to $A[v_i] \oplus x_i$.
</p>

<p>
  After performing all operations, Pak Chanek gives that array to Chaneka. Now, Chaneka is asked
  to empty the array using the same $u_j$ $v_j$ $x_j$ operations, for $j \ge 1$, with the condition
  that the number of operations must be minimized. The operations doesn't have to be the same
  as those performed by Pak Chanek. In other words, Chaneka is allowed to decide their own
  operations.
</p>

<p>
  Chaneka wants to complete this challenge by themselves. However, they are unsure if the number
  of operations they have performed is minimal. Thus, to help Chaneka, write a program that
  calculates the minimum number of operations required to complete the challenge.
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p>
  The first line consists of two integers $N$ and $Q$ — the size of the array and number of
  operations performed by Pak Chanek.
</p>

<p>
  The next $Q$ lines consists of three integers $u_i$, $v_i$, and $x_i$ — the operations
  performed by Pak Chanek.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p>
  Output an integer that states the minimum operations required by Chaneka to complete Pak
  Chanek's challenge.

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p>
    At first, $A = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$.
    <ul>
        <li>After operation $1$ $3$ $1$, $A = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]$.</li>
        <li>After operation $2$ $3$ $2$, $A = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0]$.</li>
        <li>After operation $3$ $4$ $3$, $A = [1, 2, 0, 3, 0]$.</li>
        <li>After operation $2$ $3$ $3$, $A = [1, 1, 3, 3, 0]$.</li>
        <li>After operation $3$ $5$ $4$, $A = [1, 1, 7, 3, 4]$.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    To empty this array, Chaneka only needs to perform $3$ operations.
    One such possibility for these three operations are
    <ul>
        <li>Perform operation $1$ $2$ $1$, thus $A$ is now $[0, 0, 7, 3, 4]$.</li>
        <li>Perform operation $3$ $4$ $3$, thus $A$ is now $[0, 0, 4, 0, 4]$.</li>
        <li>Perform operation $3$ $5$ $4$, thus $A$ is now $[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]$.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    There are no solutions that empties the array $A$ with less operations.
