<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
    Once upon a time, there was a mighty and brave king named Raja Dengklek.
    Due to his infinite wisdom, Kerajaan Dengklek became a prosperous
    nation, rivaling other kingdoms. Raja Dengklek is very proud of his
    achievement. However, he still wants to accomplish one more achievement,
    so he will be memorialized for all eternity. In the end, he decided
    to expand his kingdom. To do so, he will conquer Kerajaan Bondol,
    the neighboring kingdom.
</p>

<p>
    Kerajaan Bondol consists of $N$ cities numbered from $1$ to $N$.
    The cities are connected with $M$ <b>one-way roads</b>. City $1$ is 
    the capital city of Kerajaan Bondol. <b>It is guaranteed that every
    other city that isn't city $1$, there is a route from that city to
    the capital city (city $1$).</b>
</p>

<p>
    Raja Dengklek knows that to conquer a nation, he needs to take over
    the capital city and all other cities will submit soon after. Using
    that strategy, Raja Dengklek dispatched two of his best governors:
    Pak Chanek and Pak Ganesh. Their mission is one: To lead Raja Dengklek's
    army into Kerajaan Bondol's capital city.
</p>

<p>
    To complete his mission, Raja Dengklek will also send in $K$ army 
    battalions, numbered from $1$ to $K$. The $i$-th battalion has been
    deployed into city $A_i$. The battalion deployment is not unique.
    Thus, there could be two or more battalions that are deployed in the
    same city. A battalion can move from its current city to another city
    iff there is a one-way road connecting the two cities.
</p>

<p>
    Pak Chanek and Pak Ganesh will alternatingly give commands to their soldiers,
    starting from Pak Chanek. Each turn, a governor can command <b>exactly one</b>
    battalion to move from its current city to another city that is directly
    connected to its current city. Because Raja Dengklek wants to finish the 
    war as fast as possible, a governor must give a command each turn they get.
    The war is said to be over if at least one battalion has reached the capital
    city.
</p>

<p>
    Pak Chanek and Pak Ganesh are both smart and loyal governors. However, both
    of them thirst to be renowned. Thus, both Pak Chanek and Pak Ganesh want to be
    the first person to reach the capital city. They will try to make their rival
    not be the first to send the army into city $1$.
</p>

<p>
    Pak Chanek is pretty sure that he will be able to defeat Pak Ganesh. However,
    to guarantee his victory, Pak Chanek asks for your help to direct the army
    such that Pak Chanek will be the first to reach the capital.
</p>

<p>
    You are asked whether Pak Chanek will win this game or not.
</p>

    </li>
    <li>The next $M$ lines consist of a pair of integers $U_i$ and $V_i$, denoting
        a one-way road from $U$ to $V$.
    </li>
    <li>The last line consists of $K$ space-separated integers: 
        $A_1, A_2, A_3, \dots, A_K$. $A_i$ is the starting position of the $i$-th
        battalion.
