<!-- Title : Chanek's Stroll -->

  The city Depok can be represented as a grid of $N$ rows and $M$ columns. The top-left square of the grid is represented as $(1, 1)$ 
  and the bottom-right square of the grid is represented as $(N, M)$.
</p>

<p>
  Pak Chanek starts at square $(1, 1)$ at the $1$st second. Pak Chanek will then take a stroll around Depok. Each second, he will decide
  to walk to the square on his right, the square below him, or stay still on the current square he's in.
