<!-- Title : Moving the Capital City -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
    Once upon a time, there was a kingdom named Kerajaan Dengkritus. The kingdom 
    wasn't the richest or the strongest, but its citizens were enthusiastic
    in developing the kingdom. Currently, the kingdom was under the rule of
    Raja Dengklek XI. Raja Dengklek is always the decision maker for all important
    issues, as a king should be. For example, Raja Dengklek has just agreed to a plan
    given by his advisor: They will move the capital city of the kingdom, Dengkritapolis
    to a different region.
</p>

<p>
    The citizens of Kerajaan Dengkritus have varying opinions on this decision. Some
    are very happy because the current situation in the capital city isn't sustainable,
    thus it should be relocated. There are others that support the decision for economic
    equality. Yet others believe the idea of relocating the capital city is insane,
    as it would require enourmous fees to be executed.
</p>

<p>
    Many discussions were held about this decision, one such discussion is held
    by the Dengkritus Coders Club (DCC), which became the centre of discussion for 
    all the best thinkers around the kingdom. One day, DCC held a debate regarding
    this issue. The debate was heated. The skeptics keep asking questions about how
    the capital city relocation would be realized. Suddenly, an ingenious thinker named
    Pak Chanek emerges. He then states:
</p>

<p><b>We should take Dengkritapolis, and push it somewhere else!</b></p>

<p><img alt="actually useless image" src="render/pat-meme.gif"></p>

<p>
    The whole room goes quiet hearing these words. Soon after, Pak Chanek receives
    a call from the king. Raja Dengklek has decided to relocate the kingdom by 
    pushing it, just as Pak Chanek said. For some reason, all the skeptics decided
    to agree with this idea. All the citizens cheered, ready to help push Dengkritapolis
    to a new region.
</p>

<p>
    Pak Chanek was designated as the leader of this project. He acquires the route
    of the kingdom relocation with haste. As it turns out, there are $N$ key locations
    that will be passed by Dengkritapulis during its movement. The locations are numbered
    from $1$ to $N$, with location $1$ denoting Dengkritapolis' initial location and 
    location $N$ denoting the promised land, where New Dengkritapolis will be.
    To move from location $1$ to location $N$, Pak Chanek decides to move the capital
    from location $1$ to location $2$, to location $3$, and so on until they reach location
    $N$. Pushing the capital city will take time. In general, it takes $(j - i)$ days
    to move the capital from location $i$ to $j$ for all $(1 \le i < j \le N)$. Pak Chanek
    will not move backwards, as the citizens will not want to return to a location they have
    passed. "Stuff like that will waste our time", they thought. 
</p>

<p>
    In the middle of planning, Pak Chanek is visited by Empu Ganesh. Empu Ganesh offers
    himself to help Pak Chanek. With his sacred powers, Empu Ganesh can perform $M$ spells.
    The $i$-th spell can move the capital city from location $A_i$ to $B_i$ ($A_i < B_i$) in
    just one day! Note that to use the $i$-th spell, Dengkritapolis must be in location $A_i$.
</p>

<p>
    Raja Dengklek wants to relocate the capital city as fast as possible. Help Pak Chanek
    determine the minimum time required to move Dengkritapolis from location $1$ to $N$.
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p>The first line contains an integer $T$ — the number of test cases.
   Each test case is stated as follows.
</p>

<p>
  The first line consists of two integers $N$ and $M$ — the number of key locations and the number of
  Spells Empu Ganesh has respectively.
</p>

<p>
  The next $M$ lines contains two integers $A_i$ and $B_i$ — the starting location and ending location
  of Empu Ganesh's $i$-th spell.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p>
    For each test case, output an integer $X$, the minimum time for Pak Chanek to move the capital city.
</p>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>

9 19

<h3>Sample Output</h3>

<pre>

</pre>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>
    In the first sample, Pak Chanek moves the capital from location $1$ to $3$ in $2$ days, then
    uses Empu Chanek's power to move the capital from location $3$ to $7$ in $1$ day, then pushes
    the capital to location $10$ in $3$ days. In total, it took Pak Chanek $2 + 1 + 3 = 6$ days.
</p>

<p>
    In the second sample, Pak Chanek will move the capital to location $9$, use a spell to location $19$,
    and perform a final push to location $20$. Note that Pak Chanek is not allowed to use spell $1$ then
    push the capital city backwards to location $9$, because the citizens will be angry.
