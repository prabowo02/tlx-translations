<!-- Title: Es Kepal Moli -->
<h3>Description</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Jelix is a fan of a beverage called <em>es kepal moli</em>. Right now, he has $$$3N$$$ <em>es
  kepal moli</em> arranged from left to right. Each <em>es kepal moli</em> has a different level of
  tastiness. Let the level of tastiness be represented as $$$a_1, a_2, ..., a_{3N}$$$.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Because he is generous, Jelix wants to share those <em>es kepal moli</em> to:
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  1. Beggar<br>
  First, Jelix picks any $$$N$$$ <em>es kepal moli</em> to be given to a beggar.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  2. Fingga<br>
  Then, Jelix picks $$$N$$$ right-most <em>es kepal moli</em> (that has not been given to the
  beggar) to be shared with his friend Fingga.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  3. Jelix<br>
  After that, $$$N$$$ remaining <em>es kepal moli</em> are kept for himself.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Jelix wants the value of the sum of level of tastiness of his <em>es kepal moli</em>
  subtracted by that of Fingga's to be <b>MAXIMIZED</b>. Determine the maximal value that Jelix
  can obtain.
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Input starts with a positive integer $$$T$$$ ($$$1 &le; T &le; 100$$$) that determines the
  number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The first line consists of one positive integer $$$N$$$ ($$$1 &le; N &le; 100000$$$).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The next line consists of $$$3N$$$ positive integers separated by spaces which determine $$$a_1,
  a_2, ..., a_{3N}$$$ ($$$1 &le; a_i &le; 10^9$$$).
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For each test case, output "Kasus #$$$X$$$: $$$Y$$$". $$$X$$$ represents the case number
  (starting from 1), and $$$Y$$$ represents the maximum difference between Jelix's sum of
  tastiness and Fingga's sum of tastiness.
</p>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre>
2
3
8 2 2 7 4 6 5 3 8
1
1 2 3
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>
Kasus #1: 5
Kasus #2: -1
</pre>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>
  For the first test case, Jelix shares his <em>es kepal moli</em> as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gives <em>es kepal moli</em> of tastiness 2, 2, and 8 to the beggar,</li>
  <li>Shares <em>es kepal moli</em> of tastiness 6, 5, and 3 to Fingga,</li>
  <li>Keeps <em>es kepal moli</em> of tastiness 8, 7, and 4 for himself.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Hence, the difference is (8+7+4) - (6+5+3) = 5.
