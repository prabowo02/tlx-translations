<!-- Title: Group Assignment -->

<h3>Description</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Feli is a student at a popular university. One day, Feli is given a group assignment consisting
  of $$$N$$$ questions. The $$$i$$$-th question can be solved in $$$X_i$$$ amount of time. Because
  the group assignment has many questions, Feli formed a group of $$$M$$$ people
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  To complete the group assignment, Feli's group agrees to split work among them. Each member
  chooses two integers $$$L$$$ and $$$R$$$, and the member has to solve questions from $$$L$$$ to
  $$$R$$$ inclusive.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  With this method, each question can be solved by more than one member. The questions, however,
  remain at the same difficulty so that the time needed to solve the $$$i$$$-th question is still
  $$$X_i$$$. The time it takes for a member to solve the questions is equal to the sum of the time
  it takes to solve each question.
</p>
<p style="text-aligh: justify;">
  Feli's group wants to minimize the amount of the time they spend on solving the questions. Help
  Feli's group determine the minimum time they can spend!
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Input starts with a positive integer $$$T$$$, the number of test cases, and the next lines will
  be explained below.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The first line consists of two positive integer $$$N$$$ and $$$M$$$ - the number of questions
  and Feli's friends. The next line consists of $$$N$$$ integer $$$X_i$$$, the time it takes to
  solve the $$$i$$$-th question.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For each test case, output "Case #$$$X$$$: $$$Y$$$". $$$X$$$ represents the case number (starting
  from 1), and $$$Y$$$ represents the minimum time Feli's group can spend.
</p>
