<!-- Title : Fingga Boyz -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  Fingga Boyz, or so the knights of the kingdom of Bollyjee are called. In the kingdom of Bollyjee, there are $N$ Fingga Boyz that have achieved many victories on the battlefield. Jelix, as king of Bollyjee, wants to give some appreciation to the Fingga Boyz in the form of a house for each person. Due to unknown reasons, there are only $K$ available houses. Each house is numbered from $1$ to $K$. Each member of the Fingga Boyz wants to stay in the house with their family, hence there must be no houses that are given to two or more different knights.
</p>

<p>
  To not cause a racket between the Fingga Boyz, Jelix requests everyone to queue up and give their preferences for their dream home to Jelix personally. In order to be fair, the $i$-th person that arrives only gets $i$ preferences.
</p>

<p>
  After all preferences have been acquired. Jelix starts divvying up the houses. Jelix will start giving the houses (based on their preferences) to the person that gave the preference first. If there are more than one possible houses that could be given, Jelix will give the smaller numbered house that hasn't been given to someone else.
</p>

<p>
  Just as Jelix was about to start divvying the houses, the kingdom of Bondol suddenly arrives to talk business with Jelix. Jelix asks you, as his right-hand man, to divvy up the homes. Determine the house number received by each member of the Fingga Boyz.

<h3>Input Format</h3>
<p>
  Input starts with an integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 10$) — the number of test cases. Each test case starts with two integers $N$ and $K$ ($1 \le N \le K \le 100$) — the member count of the Fingga Boyz and the number of houses available. It is then followed by $N$ lines, where the $i$-th line consists of $i$ <b>distinct</b> integers $P_{i,x}$ ($1 \le P_{i,x} \le K$), representing $i$-th person's home preferences. 
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p>
  For each test case, output <code>Kasus #X: </code>, where $X$ is the test case number (starting from $$$1$$$). It is then followed by $N$ space-separated integers that show what house number the $i$-th person received. Output <code>Tidak ada pembagian</code> if not everyone can get their own homes.
