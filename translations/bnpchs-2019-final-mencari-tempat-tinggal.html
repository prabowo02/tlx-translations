<!-- Title : Housing Hunt -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Feli is a university student looking for a place to stay. 
  The city where Feli lives in is made up of $$$N$$$ intersections connected by $$$N - 1$$$ roads. 
  It is guaranteed that every pair of intersections are connected directly or indirectly through multiple roads.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Feli, an active university student, often visits $$$M$$$ intersections known as meeting spots. 
  Feli surely wants to stay in a place that minimizes the furthest distance from that place to any of the $$$M$$$ spots. 
  The distance traveled by Feli is the number of intersections that are passed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Luckily, each intersection has a place that Feli could stay in. 
  Feli can only choose one place to stay in. Help Feli determine where she will stay.
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Input starts with an integer $$$T$$$ â€” the number of test cases.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Each test case starts with two integers $$$N$$$ and $$$M$$$, 
  where $$$N$$$ is the number of intersections and $$$M$$$ is the number of meeting spots. 
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Each of the next $$$N - 1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$U$$$ and $$$V$$$, 
  indicating a road between intersection $$$U$$$ and intersection $$$V$$$. 
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The final line contains $$$M$$$ integers, where each integer denotes one of Feli's meeting spots.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For each test case, output "Case #$$$X$$$: $$$Y$$$ $$$Z$$$", 
  where $$$X$$$ is the case number (starting from $$$1$$$), 
  $$$Y$$$ is the intersection number where Feli stays, 
  and $$$Z$$$ is the furthest distance from Feli's location to any of the $$$M$$$ spots.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  If there are multiple intersections that Feli could stay in, 
  she would pick the lowest possible intersection number.
</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
  <li style="text-align: justify;">$$$1 \le T \le 5$$$.</li>
  <li style="text-align: justify;">$$$1 \le N \le 2 \times 10^5$$$.</li>
  <li style="text-align: justify;">$$$2 \le M \le N$$$.</li>
  <li style="text-align: justify;">$$$1 \le U, V \le N$$$.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>

<pre>
Case #1: 1 1
Case #2: 4 2
Case #3: 2 2
</pre>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
   For case $$$3$$$, there are two intersections that Feli could stay in, intersection $$$2$$$ or intersection $$$4$$$. 
   She would pick intersection $$$2$$$ since that is the lowest possible intersection number.
