<h3>Description</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Dokemon Orange is a game that is newly released. 
	The aim of this game is to catch all Dokemons in the game. 
	Feli, who recently played Dokemon Orange, 
	wants to catch all Dokemons. However, a specific device 
	is needed to catch a Dokemon, called a Dokeball.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Feli recieved information that Dokeballs are actually sold in a special market.
	This market is special as every player can only do one transaction.
	The Dokeballs in the special market are sold with the following rules:
</p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">
		The price of a Dokeball is an integer between $$$L$$$ and $$$R$$$ inclusive
	</li><li style="text-align: justify;">
		There is only one Dokeball available for every price.
	</li><li style="text-align: justify;">
		In one transaction, the player must choose two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ between $$$L$$$ and $$$R$$$ inclusive where $$$a$$$ is less than $$$b$$$
	</li><li style="text-align: justify;">
		The player must buy all Dokeballs from $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$ inclusive.
	</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	The total price to buy all Dokeballs from $$$a$$$ to $$$b$$$ is $$$f(a, b)$$$, where:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
	$$$
    f(a, b) = \left.
            \begin{cases}
                \scriptstyle
                a, & if a = b \\
                \scriptstyle
                g(a, f(a+1, b)), & otherwise \\
            \end{cases}
      \right\}
    $$$
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
	and
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
	$$$
    g(a, b) = a + b - 2 \times (a \wedge b)
    $$$
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
	where $$$\wedge$$$ represents the bitwise AND operator.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Feli only has $$$M$$$ amount of money and she wants to buy 
	as many Dokeballs as possible. Help Feli so that she can know 
	what is the maximum number of Dokeballs that can be bought!
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	The first line contains a positive integer $$$T$$$ 
	which represents the number of test cases.
	The next T lines contains 3 positive integers $$$L, R,$$$ and $$$M$$$ 
	where $$$L$$$ until $$$R$$$ represents the price of $$$(R-L+1)$$$ 
	Dokeballs and $$$M$$$ represents the amount of money Feli has.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	For every test case, the format of output is "Case #$$$X$$$: $$$Y$$$" 
	where $$$X$$$ represents the test case number which is counted from 1 
	and $$$Y$$$ represents the maximum number of Dokeballs that can be bought by Feli.
</p>
