<!-- Title: Blusukan -->
<h3>Description</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The general election of Bollyjee country is around the corner. Jelix as one of the presidential  
  candidates wants to know the national needs by doing <i>blusukan</i> (blusukan 
  is an Indonesian word that refers to hands-on interaction with the public in order to notice their 
  necessity).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  There are a bunch of islands and $N$ provinces in Bollyjee. Two provinces can lie on the 
  same or different islands. Jelix has $M$ information, where each information provides two provinces 
  that lie on the same island. If provinces $A$ and $B$ lie on the same island, and provinces $B$ and $C$ lie 
  on the same island, then provinces $A$ and $C$ also lie on the same island.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Each pair of provinces on an island are connected by a road. It is also known that for each pair of roads 
  there is an alley that connects them so that Jelix can go from a road to the other road through this 
  alley. Furthermore, Jelix can use air transport to travel between islands. He can take off from any island 
  and land on any island.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The <em>blusukan</em> program that Jelix uses is as follow:
  <ul>
  <li>Jelix can start or end his program in any province on any island.</li>
  <li>Jelix wants to visit <b>all roads</b> in Bollyjee <b>exactly once</b>.</li>
  <li>Alleys and roads are considered different. Jelix does not have to visit every alley and the order of visits is ignored.</li>
  <li>Because air transports are expensive, Jelix will fly from an island to another island only if he has visited all the roads on the island exactly once.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Jelix requested you to find how many different orders of the road he will visit. Output the value modulo $10^9 + 7$.
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Input starts with an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 100$) — the number of test cases.<br>
  Each test case consists of two integers $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 2000$) and $M$ ($0 \leq M \leq \min(10^5, N \times (N-1)/2)$). <br>
  Then the next $M$ lines each contains 2 integers $A$ and $B$ ($1 ≤ A < B ≤ N$) which means provinces $A$ and $B$ lie on the same island. 
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For each test case, output <code>Kasus #X: Y</code>, where $X$ is the case number (starting from $1$), and $Y$ is the number of different orders of the roads he will visit modulo $10^9 + 7$.
</p>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>

<pre>
4
10 1
1 2
3 3
1 2
2 3
1 3
5 0
7 4
1 2
2 3
4 5
4 6
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>

<pre>
Kasus #1: 1
Kasus #2: 6
Kasus #3: 1
Kasus #4: 72
</pre>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In the first case, there is only one road, thus there is only 1 possible order. <br>
  In the second case, all possible orders are as follow:
  <ul><b><u>
    <li>(1, 2) → (1, 3) → (2, 3)</li>
    <li>(1, 2) → (2, 3) → (1, 3)</li>
    <li>(1, 3) → (1, 2) → (2, 3)</li>
    <li>(1, 3) → (3, 2) → (2, 1)</li>
    <li>(2, 3) → (2, 1) → (1, 3)</li>
    <li>(2, 3) → (3, 1) → (1, 2)</li>
  </u></b></ul>
  In the third case, Jelix can only stay put because there is no road, therefore the answer is 1.<br>
  In the fourth case, provinces $(1, 2, 3)$ lie on the same island while provinces $(4, 5, 6)$ lie on the other island.<br>
