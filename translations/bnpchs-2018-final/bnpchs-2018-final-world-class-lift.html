<h3>Description</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  World Class University has a sky-high building for student residence. 
  This residence is called "World Square" or often abbreviated as WS. 
  WS building had a World Class Elevator. 
  Because of the extraordinary quality, WS only needs one elevator to accommodate all of the collegers.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  You need to find the least number of stops required for the World Class Elevator 
  to drop off all of the elevator passengers from the first floor without annoying any of the passengers. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Mind that every passenger has differing <b>elevator tolerance value</b>.
  The elevator tolerance value is the number of floors 
  the passenger will not mind when the passenger is dropped not on the desired floor 
  (after the ride, the passenger will go to the desired floor using stairs). 
  Each person has a desired floor $$$X$$$ and elevator tolerance value of $$$Y$$$. 
  This means the passenger will not get annoyed if the passenger is dropped between the $$$(X - Y)$$$-th floor and $$$(X + Y)$$$-th floor (inclusive).   
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Input starts with a single integer $$$T (1 \leq T \leq 10)$$$, where $T$ is the number of test cases. 
  The next lines contain the description of each test case as explained below. <br>
  The first line of each case contains a positive integer $$$N (1 \leq N \leq 10^5) - $$$ the number of passengers. <br>
  The next $$$N$$$ lines contain 2 integers $$$X_{i} (2 \leq X_{i} \leq 10^5)$$$ and $$$Y_{i} (0 \leq Y_{i} \leq 10^5) - $$$ 
  the destination and the elevator tolerance value of the $$$i$$$-th passenger. 
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For each test case, output "Kasus #$$$X$$$: $$$Y$$$" (without quotation marks), where $$$X$$$ is the case number starting from 1, 
  and $$$Y$$$ is the least number of stop required for World Class Elevator to drop off all of the passengers.

2 2
3 1
4 0
5 1
6 2

<h3>Sample Output</h3>

<pre>
Kasus #1: 1
Kasus #2: 2  
</pre>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For the first case, the World Class Elevator would only stop once on the fourth floor. <br>
  In the second case, the World Class Elevator will stop twice. One of the ways is by stopping in the second and twelfth floor.
