<!-- Title : Jelix and the Adorable Ants -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  Jelix likes to play with the line of ants in his bathroom. 
  He thinks those ants are adorable even though all of them have different shapes and sizes.
</p>

<p>
  One day, when he was sitting in the bathroom, he started daydreaming. 
  In his dream, an ant in that line received radiation and changed into a mutant ant 
  that is not adorable. That mutant ant then started killing and eating all small ants in 
  front and behind it. Jelix was shocked, causing him to immediately wake up from his 
  daydream. He then started to measure the body sizes of the ants.
</p>

<p>
  Jelix numbers the ants from $1$ to $N$ (ant $1$ is at the front of the line, 
  and ant $N$ is at the back of the line). Ant $i$ has body size $U_i$. 
  A mutant ant will kill and eat all ants smaller than itself that is in front of the 
  mutant ant until it meets an ant of <b>equal or greater size than</b> itself. 
  After that, the mutant ant turns around and starts eating all ants smaller than itself 
  that is behind the mutant ant until it meets an ant of <b>equal or greater size than</b> 
  itself.
</p>

<p>
  The killings are formally defined as such: 
  Ant $i$ that mutates will kill all ants $j$ that satisfies 
  $L < i, j < R$, $j \neq i$, and $U_j < U_i \le U_L, U_R$ 
</p>

<p>
  Jelix wants to know if an adorable ant turns into a mutant ant, how many ants 
  will become victims of the mutant ant?
</p>


<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p>
  Input starts with an integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 10$) — the number of test cases. 
  Each test case starts with an integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 100\,000$) — the number of ants. 
  The next line consists of $N$ integers $U_1, U_2, U_3, \dots, U_N$ 
  ($1 \le U_i \le 100\,000$) where $U_i$ is the body size of ant $i$. 
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p>
  For each test case, output <code>Kasus #X: </code>, where $X$ is the test case number 
  (starting from $1$). It is then followed by $N$ space-separated integers 
  $A_1, A_2, \cdot, A_N$ where $A_i$ is the number of adorable ants that will be eaten 
  if ant $i$ becomes a mutant.
</p>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>

<pre>
1
5
3 1 2 1 3
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>

<pre>
Kasus #1: 3 0 2 0 3
</pre>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<ul>
  <li style="text-align: justify;">If ant $1$ becomes a mutant, it will eat ants $2, 3, 4$.</li>
  <li style="text-align: justify;">If ant $3$ becomes a mutant, it will eat ants $2, 4$.</li>
  <li style="text-align: justify;">If ant $5$ becomes a mutant, it will eat ants $2, 3, 4$.</li>
  <li style="text-align: justify;">No ants die if ant $2$ or ant $4$ becomes a mutant.</li>
</ul>
