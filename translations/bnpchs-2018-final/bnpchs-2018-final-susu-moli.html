  about the method of making <em>Es Kepal Moli</em>. 
  Surprisingly, one of the ingredients used by Jelix is Moli branded milk.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Currently, there are $$$N$$$ bottles of Moli Milk in Jelix's fridge. 
  Everyday, Jelix will use $$$A$$$ Moli Milk bottles to make <em>Es Kepal Moli</em>. 
  To keep in stock, Jelix also buys $$$B$$$ Moli Milk bottles every day and then stores them in the fridge. 
  Obviously, Jelix buys more Moli Milk bottles than the amount he uses each day. 
  Fingga is curious about how many bottles of Moli Milks there are in Jelix's fridge after $$$K$$$ days.
