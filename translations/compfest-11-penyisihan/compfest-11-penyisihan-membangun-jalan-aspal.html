	Mr. Chanek will make $Q$ trips in succession. On the $i$-th trip, Mr. Chanek will depart from city $A_i$ to city $B_i$. For each trip, Mr. Chanek would like the shortest path from $A_i$ to $B_i$ are all paved. Mr. Chanek would like to know the total cost to pave all unpaved roads on the shortest path from city $A_i$ to city $B_i$. After that, Mr. Chanek will pave all the roads on the shortest path from city $A_i$ to city $B_i$. Paved roads remains paved for future trips.
</p>

	The first line consists of two integers $N$ and $Q$ representing the number of cities and the number of trips, respectively.
</p>

<p>
	The following $N-1$ lines consists of three integers $U_i$, $V_i$, and $C_i$ representing the road connecting city $U_i$ and $V_i$ and price $C_i$ to pave the $i$-th road.
</p>

<p>
	The following $Q$ lines consist of two integers $A_i$ and $B_i$ representing Pak Chanek's trip.
