</p>

<p>
  Mr. Chanek and Mr. Ganesh do not like when the same index contain the same number in both arrays. A number on an index is the same if $A_i$ = $B_i$ for some value $i$. Now Mr. Chaneks asks, if he and Mr. Ganesh shuffles the numbers they have, is there a scenario where the numbers on the same index does not exceed $K$.
