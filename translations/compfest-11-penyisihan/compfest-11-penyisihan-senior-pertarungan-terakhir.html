<!-- Title : The Last Battle -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
	Mr. Chanek is playing his favorite video game. In the game, he has $N$ heroes standing in order
	from the first hero on the left to the $N$-th hero on the right. Hero $i$ has a power level of $A_i$.
</p>

<p>
	Mr. Chanek is currently facing the final boss. Mr. Chanek's best friend, Mr. Dengklek, gave him a tip 
	that to defeat the final boss, he must divide his heroes to exactly $M$ platoons by placing $M - 1$ 
	barriers between two heroes. There must be at most one barrier between two adjacent heroes. The heroes 
	which are not divided from the barriers form a platoon. The platoons are numbered from 1 to $M$ from 
	left to right. The platoons must be divided in such a way that the power level of the strongest hero in 
	the $i$-th platoon is exactly $B_i$.
</p>

<p>
	Now Mr. Chanek is curious, how many possible configurations of platoons are there such that he can 
	defeat the final boss.
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p>
	The first line contains 2 positive integers $N$ and $M$, the number of heroes and the number of platoons.
</p>

<p>
	The next line contains $N$ integers $A_i$, the power level of the $i$-th hero.
</p>

<p>
	The next line contains $M$ integers $B_i$, the maximum power level of the $i$-th platoon.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p>
	An integer representing the number of platoon configurations. As the number can be large, output the answer in 
	modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.
</p>

<h3>Sample Input 1</h3>

<pre>
8 3
1 1 3 2 2 1 3 1
3 2 3
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output 1</h3>

<pre>
5
</pre>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p>
	The valid configuration of platoons for sample 1 are the following:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		1 1 3 | 2 | 2 1 3 1
	</li>
	<li>
		1 1 3 | 2 2 | 1 3 1
	</li>
	<li>
		1 1 3 | 2 2 1 | 3 1
	</li>
	<li>
		1 1 3 2 | 2 | 1 3 1
	</li>
	<li>
		1 1 3 2 | 2 1 | 3 1
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	There are 5 valid ways of dividing the platoons. There are no possible configurations other than the stated above.
</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
		$1 \le M \le N \le 2000$
	</li>
	<li>
		$1 \le A_i, B_i \le 1\,000\,000\,000$
	</li>
</ul>
