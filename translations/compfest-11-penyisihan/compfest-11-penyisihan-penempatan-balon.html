<!-- Title : Balloon Placement -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
    Pak Chanek has an enormous zoo. Besides generating profit, that zoo is also dedicated
    to caring for and protecting endangered species.
</p>

<p>
    As it turns out, there's a unique tradition by animal care organizations to acknowledge
    distinguished zoos such as Pak Chanek's zoo. For each animal adopted by Pak Chanek,
    the organization will gift a balloon that Pak Chanek can display in his zoo's garden.
</p>

<p>
    Year by year passes and Pak Chanek's zoo keeps receiving balloons for each rare animal he
    rescues. Eventually, the number of balloons ballooned to a point where the visitors cannot
    count the number of balloons in the zoo anymore. 
</p>

<p>
  In order to solve this issue, Pak Chanek decided he will discard a few balloons from the garden.
  But, Pak Chanek still wants the balloons to be able to represent the number of balloons he
  has.
</p>

<p>
  Suddenly, Pak Chanek discovers a brilliant idea: he will place the balloons such that when viewed from
  above with a drone, the balloons will form a number that is equal to the number of balloons Pak Chanek owns.
  Sadly, due to the large number of balloons owned by Pak Chanek, he is confused as to how to place
  his balloons, as such he requests your assistance.
</p>

<p>
    Pak Chanek's courtyard can be represented as a grid consisting of $R \times C$ squares.
    Pak Chanek has $N$ balloons that he wants to place in the courtyard. Each square can contain
    at most one balloon. Pak Chanek wants to place these balloons such that when viewed from
    above, the balloons will form the number $N$.
</p>

<p>
    As for the shapes of the numbers, Pak Chanek decided to use the display seen in seven-segment
    displays, examples of which can be seen below.
    <br>
    <img alt="seven segment" src="render/seven-segment.png">
</p>

<p>
    For example, if Pak Chanek wants to form the number $9$, he will place his balloons 
    as such:
    <br>
    <img alt="gambar 1" src="render/gambar-1.png" style="height: 250px;">
</p>

<p>
    In the image above, the gray-colored squares are squares with a balloon 
    and the white-colored squares are empty.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>
        Note that for the two images above, the height of each digit is $5$ 
        and its width is $3$. Notice also that the number $1$ must always be aligned
        to the right. Even though it might seem that the number has width $1$, it actually
        has width $3$, but a thickness of $1$. The rules of number formation
        will be elaborated further in the next few paragraphs.
    </strong>
</p>

<p>
    Of course, the image above is not the only way to form the number $9$. Pak Chanek
    can also make a bigger shape or a thicker line segment. For example, see the image below:
    <br>
    <img alt="gambar 2" src="render/gambar-2.png" style="width: 600px;">
</p>

<p>
    The image above shows four valid versions of the number $9$. The leftmost image
    is the number $9$ with a width of $4$ squares and a height of $5$ squares. The second image
    from the left is the number $9$ with a width of $3$ squares and a height of $9$ squares.
    The third image from the left is the number $9$ with a width of $6$ squares and a height of $5$ squares.
    These three numbers on the right have a thickness of $1$ square. However, the numbers need not
    have a thickness of $1$ square. Take, for example, the rightmost number $9$. It has
    a width of $6$ squares, a height of $10$ squares, and a thickness of $2$ squares. 
</p>

<p>
    Pak Chanek wants the numbers to be formed elegantly. As such, there are a couple of
    rules for placing the balloons:
    <ol>
        <li>Each digit must have the same width, height, and thickness.</li>
        <li>Any two digits must be separated by at least $1$ square.</li>
        <li>The total width of the digits, including the width of the spaces in-between digits, must be $\le R$</li>
        <li>The height of each digit must be $\le C$.</li>
        <li>For visibility reasons, the thickness of each digit must be less than $\frac{1}{3}$ its 
            height and less than $\frac{1}{2}$ its width.</li>
        <li>The total number of balloons used must be $\le N$.</li>
        <li>$(\textrm{height} - \textrm{thickness})$ must be divisible by $2$.</li>
        <li>The number of balloons used must be maximized.</li>
        <li>For the numbers $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $8$, and $9$, the middle line
            of each number must be placed exactly centered.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
    The following are examples of valid and invalid balloon placements for 
    $R = 13$ and $C = 9$:

</p>

<p>
    Help Pak Chanek by giving him a valid balloon placement configuration, or output
    $-1$ if there are no valid configurations that satisfy all the rules above.
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p>
    A line, consisting of three integers $R$, $C$, and $N$ — the width of the courtyard,
    the height of the courtyard, and the number of balloons respectively.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p>
    If there are no valid solutions, output a line consisting of the integer $-1$.
</p>

<p>
    Otherwise, output a line consisting of three integers, $W$, $H$, and $T$ — the width, height, and
    the thickness of the number that satisfy all of Pak Chanek's rules. If there are multiple valid
    solutions, output any. 
</p>

<h3>Sample Input 1</h3>

<pre>
10 10 7
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output 1</h3>

<h3>Sample Input 2</h3>

<pre>
10 10 22
</pre>

</pre>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p>
    In the two cases above, all balloons are used, as shown in the image below:

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
    <li>$1 \le N \le 100\,000$</li>
    <li>$1 \le R, C \le 5\,000$</li>
