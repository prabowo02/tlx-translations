<!-- Title : Merging Monster -->

<h3> Description </h3>

<p>
	Mr. Chanek is a well known scientist in the Nation of Chanek. Mr. Chanek is researching about monsters which often attack the Nation of Chanek.
</p>

<p>
	Mr. Chanek has $N$ experimental monsters lining from left to right and numbered from $1$ to $N$. The $i$-th monster has power $A_i$.

	Mr. Chanek would like to do $M$ mergings. Mr. Chanek can choose a monster and merge it with the monster directly to the right of the former monster.

	After the merging, the two monsters will transform into a new monster with power equivalent to the sum of the powers of the two merged monsters.
</p>

<p>
	Now Mr. Chanek is wondering, after $M$ mergings, what is the maximum monster's power he has.
</p>

<h3> Input Format </h3>

<p>
	The first line consists of two integers $N$ and $M$, representing the number of experimental monsters Mr. Chanek has and the number of mergings to be done, respectively.
</p>

<p>
	The next line consists of $N$ integers $A_i$ representing the power of the $i$-th experimental monster.
</p>

<h3> Output Format </h3>

<p> 
	An integer representing the maximum experimental monster power after $M$ mergings.
</p>

<h3> Sample Input </h3>

<pre>
7 3
1 5 2 5 3 4 1
</pre>

<h3> Sample Output </h3>

<pre>
15
</pre>

<h3> Explanation </h3>

<p>
	First merging, merge the monsters at the third and the fourth positions. The monster configuration will then be 1 5 7 3 4 1.
</p>

<p>
	Second merging, merge the monsters at the second and the third positions. The monster configuration will then be 1 12 3 4 1.
</p>

<p>
	Third merging, merge the monsters at the second and the third positions. The monster configuration will then be 1 15 4 1.
</p>

<p>
	The maximum monster power after three mergings is $15$.
	One can prove that $15$ is the maximum power that can be obtained.
