<!-- Title : Grouping -->

<h3> Description </h3>

<p>
	Mr. Chanek is a teacher in a primary school. Mr. Chanek has $2N$ students where the $i$-th student has friendship level $A_i$.
</p>

<p>
	Now Mr. Chanek would like to create $N$ groups where each group consists of $2$ students. However, Mr. Chanek has a problem since the $i$-th student only wanted to group with $j$-th student if their friendship level difference is less than or equal to $K$. Formally, $|A_i - A_j| \le K$.
</p>

<p>
	Now Mr. Chanek is wondering, is there a configuration where he can create $N$ groups.
</p>


<h3> Input Format </h3>

<p>
	The first line consists of two integers $N$ and $K$.
</p>

<p>
	The following line consists of $2N$ integers representing friendship level of Mr. Chanek's students.
</p>


<h3> Output Format </h3>

<p> 
	A line consists of "Ya" (Yes in Indonesian) if Mr. Chanek is able to create N groups or "Tidak" (No in Indonesian) if not.
</p>


<h3> Sample Input 1 </h3>

<pre>
3 2
3 1 5 7 6 4
</pre>

<h3> Sample Output 1 </h3>

<pre>
Ya
</pre>


<h3> Sample Input 2 </h3>

<pre>
3 1
3 1 5 7 6 4
</pre>

<h3> Sample Output 2 </h3>

<pre>
Tidak	
</pre>


<h3> Explanation </h3>

<p>
	For the first sample, we can create 3 groups, i.e. {3, 1}, {5, 7}, {6, 4}.
</p>

<p>
	For the second sample, we cannot create 3 groups.
</p>

<h3> Constraints </h3>
<ul>
	<li> $1 \le N \le 100\,000$ </li>
	<li> $0 \le K \le 100\,000$ </li>
	<li> $1 \le A_i \le 100\,000$ for $1 \le i \le 2N$ </li>
</ul>
