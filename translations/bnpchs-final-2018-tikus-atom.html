<!-- Title: Atomic mole -->
<h3>Description</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Jelix Fingga has a house at coordinate $(0, 0, 0)$. The field near his house is resided by $N$ moles. Unfortunately, 
  Jelix's neighbour arm each mole with a hydrogen bomb. The bomb will explode immediately if there is another bomb with
  distance <b>less than</b> $R$ meters.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Jelix Fingga does not want any explosion to happen, and he wants to defuse all bombs.
  But Jelix Fingga can only defuse a bomb only if the armed mole lies at coordinate $(0, 0, 0)$.
  You can ignore a mole whose bomb has been defused.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Fortunately, Jelix Fingga has the power to control the <b>direction</b> of each mole. 
  Each mole can move in any direction in 3-dimensional space with constant velocity <b>1 meter per minute</b> 
  The moles <b>move simultaneously</b> and they <b>cannot stop</b>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Jelix Fingga knows the starting position of each mole. Each mole is given a number from $1$ to $N$ (inclusive). 
  Mole with number $i$ can be represented as a dot with initial position $(X_i, Y_i, Z_i)$. It is guaranteed that 
  the distance of any two different moles is not less than $R$ meters.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Jelix Fingga wants to know the minimum time he needs to defuse all bombs without causing any explosion. 
  Help Jelix Fingga! Assume the time needed to defuse a bomb is 0 minutes.

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Input starts with two integers $N$ and $R$ $(1 \leq N \leq 10^5, 1 \leq R \leq 100)$, 
  where $N$ is the number of moles and $R$ is the minimum explosive trigger distance of the bombs. <br>
  The next $N$ lines contain 3 integers $X_i$, $Y_i$, and $Z_i$ $(-5000 \leq X_i, Z_i \leq 5000; -5000 \leq Y_i \leq 0)$ — 
  the initial position of mole with number $i$. <br>
  It is guaranteed that the distance of any two different moles is not less than $R$ meters.

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Minimum time to defuse all bombs in minutes. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute error does not exceed $10^{−7}$.

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In the first case, the first mole needs 1 minute to go from its starting position to $(0, 0, 0)$. <br>
  In the second case, both moles need 1.73205080757 minutes to go from their starting positions to $(0, 0, 0)$. But if they move at the same time 
  from their starting position to $(0, 0, 0)$, their distance will be less than 1 meter while moving and thus will explode the bomb. One valid optimal solution is as follow:
  <ul>
    <li>The first mole moves to $(0, 0, 0)$ in 1.73205080757 minutes.</li>
    <li>The second mole avoids the first mole by moving to coordinate $(1.59807621135, −1, −1)$ 
    in 0.59807621135 minutes, then proceed to coordinate $(0, 0, 0)$ in 2.13397459622 minutes. </li>
    <li>The total time needed is 2.73205080757 minutes.</li>
    <li>Mind that we can ignore the first mole after it has been disarmed. In other words, it does not matter 
    if the distance between the first and the second mole is smaller than or equal to 1 meter.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The distance of 2 points $(X_a, Y_a, Z_a)$ and $(X_b, Y_b, Z_b)$ is $\sqrt{(X_a - X_b)^2 + (Y_a - Y_b)^2 + (Z_a - Z_b)^2}$
