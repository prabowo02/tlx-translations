<h3>Description</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Jelix Fingga has a house in coordinate $$$(0, 0, 0)$$$. The field near his house is resided by $$$N$$$ moles. Unfortunately, 
  the neighbour of Jelix arm each mole with a hydrogen bomb. The bomb will explode if there is another bomb so that 
  their distances is <b>strictly less</b> than $$$R$$$ meters.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Jelix Fingga does not want any explosion to happen, and he wants to defuse all bombs.
  But Felix Fingga can defuse a bomb only if the armed mole lying in coordinate $$$(0, 0, 0)$$$.
  You can ignore a mole if the mole has defused.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Fortunately, Jelix Fingga has the power to control the direction of each mole. 
  Each mole can have any direction possible as long as it fits in 3-dimensional space with 1 meter per minute 
  as the stationary speed. Each mole moves together as they cannot stop moving on any occasion.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Jelix Fingga knows the starting position of each mole. Each mole is given a number from 1 until $$$N$$$ (inclusive). 
  Mole with number $$$i$$$ can be illustarted as a dot in coordinate $$$(X_i, Y_i, Z_i)$$$. It is guaranteed that 
  the distance of any two different mole is more than $$$R$$$ meters.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Jelix Fingga wants to know how much time he needs to defuse all bombs without causing any explosion. 
  Help Jelix Fingga! We can assume the time to defuse a bomb is 0 second.

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Input starts with two integers $$$N$$$ and $$$R$$$ $$$(1 \leq N \leq 10^5, 1 \leq R \leq 100)$$$, 
  where $$$N$$$ is the number of moles and $$$R$$$ is the minimum distance any pair of bomb can be without causing explosion. <br>
  The next $$$N$$$ lines contain 3 integers $$$X_i$$$, $$$Y_i$$$, and $$$Z_i$$$ $$$(-5000 \leq X_i, Z_i \leq 5000; -5000 \leq Y_i \leq 0) - $$$ 
  the initial position of mole with number $$$i$$$. <br>
  It is guaranteed that the distance of any two different mole is more than $$$R$$$ meters.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Minimum time to defuse all bombs in minute. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute error does not exceed $$$10^{−6}$$$.

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For the first case, the first mole need 1 minute to go from its starting position to $$$(0, 0, 0)$$$. <br>
  In the second case, both moles need 1.73205080757 minutes to go from its starting position to $$$(0, 0, 0)$$$. But if they move at same time 
  from their starting position to $$$(0, 0, 0)$$$, their distace will less than 1 meter while moving thus explode the bomb. One valid optimal solution as follow:
  <li>
    <ul>The first mole move to $$$(0, 0, 0)$$$ in 1.73205080757 minutes.</ul>
    <ul>To maintain the distance between both moles, the second mole move to coordinate $$$((1.59807621135, −1, −1)$$$ 
    in 0.59807621135 minutes. Then proceed to coordinate $$$(0, 0, 0)$$$ in 2.13397459622. </ul>
    <ul>The duration of this process is 2.73205080757 minutes.</ul>
    <ul>Mind that we can ignore the first mole after it disarmed. In other words, it does not matter 
    if the distance between the first and the second mole is smaller than 1 meter.</li>
  </li>
</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The distance of 2 points $$$(X_a, Y_a, Z_a)$$$ and $$$(X_b, Y_b, Z_b)$$$ is $$$\sqrt{(X_a - X_b)^2 + (Y_a - Y_b)^2 + (Z_a - Z_b)^2}$$$
