<h3>Description</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In a 1 dimensional coordinate system, Feli has a rabbit named Rbit. Rbit likes to jump a lot. In every jump, Rbit can jump to the right or to the left.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Every time Rbit jumps, the jump distance is reduced by 1 compared to the previous distance. If Rbit jumps with distance 7 from coordinate 3 to 10, then in the next jump, it jumps with distance 6 and ends up in either coordinate 4 or 16. As Rbit loves jumping, Rbit will keep jumping until its jumping distance reaches 0. Rbit can also jump to a negative coordinate point.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Rbit lives at coordinate point 0 and wants to go outside. The only way out is at the coordinate point $$$N$$$. Help Rbit to get outside by specifying the minimum first jumping distance and the direction of every jump so that Rbit stops right at coordinate $$$N$$$. If Rbit cannot go outside, output "-1".
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Input starts with a single integer $$$T$$$, the number of test cases. The next $$$T$$$ lines contain a single positive integer $$$N$$$ where $$$N$$$ is the coordinate position to be achieved.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For each test case, if Rbit can go outside output "Case #$$$X$$$: $$$Y$$$ $$$S$$$" where $$$X$$$ is the case number, starting from 1, $$$Y$$$ is the minimum jumping distance of Rbit, and $$$S$$$ is a string of length $$$Y$$$ that represents the direction of every jump ($$$S_i$$$ contains "+" if Rbit jumps to the right at the $$$i$$$-th jump, or "-" otherwise). If there is more than one way to achieve the goal, output any of it. If Rbit can't get outside output "Case #$$$X$$$: -1" instead.
</p>

Case #1: 1 +
Case #2: 2 ++
Case #3: 3 ++-
</pre>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In the third case, Rbit can jump 3 to the right, 2 to the right, and lastly 1 to the left to reach position 4.
