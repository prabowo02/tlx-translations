<h3>Description</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Feli is a Computer Science student. One day, her computer is infected with a strange virus. The virus causes Feli's monitor to display a binary string (consisting of only zeroes and ones).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Due to her boredom, she decided to determine whether the binary string in her monitor contains exactly one "00" substring. Once realizing that the possibility of exactly one "00" substring appearing in the whole string being minuscule, she then decided that she could perform the following operation: swap the positions of any two characters within the string.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Feli wants to change the string as fast as possible, such that the resulting string has exactly one "00" substring. Help Feli by telling her the minimum number of operations required to do it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A substring is a contiguous segment of a string. For example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li style="text-align: justify;">"01" is a valid substring of "0100" whereas "11", "101", and "000" is not a valid substring of "0100"</li>
  <li style="text-align: justify;">"000" has $$$3$$$ "0" substrings, $$$2$$$ "00" substrings, and $$$1$$$ "000" substring</li>
</ul>


<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Input starts with an integer $$$T$$$ — the number of test cases. <br>
  Each test case consists of two lines, <br>
  The first line contains an integer $$$N$$$ — the length of the binary string, <br>
  The next line contains a binary string of length $$$N$$$
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For each test case, output "Case #$$$X$$$: $$$Y$$$", where $$$X$$$ is the case number (starting from $$$1$$$), and $$$Y$$$ is the minimum number of operations required. If it is impossible to get a string with exactly one "00" substring, output $$$-1$$$.
</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
  <li style="text-align: justify;">$$$1 \le T \le 5$$$.</li>
  <li style="text-align: justify;">$$$1 \le N \le 2000$$$.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>

6
101000
10
0100000111
4
0000
5
10011
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>

<pre>
Case #1: 1
Case #2: 2
Case #3: -1
Case #4: 0
</pre>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<ul>
  <li style="text-align: justify;">For case $$$1$$$, we can swap characters at positions $$$1$$$ and $$$5$$$</li>
  <li style="text-align: justify;">For case $$$2$$$, we can swap characters at positions $$$4$$$ and $$$8$$$, followed by positions $$$6$$$ and $$$10$$$</li>
  <li style="text-align: justify;">For case $$$3$$$, no matter how many operations are performed, it is impossible to get a string with <b>EXACTLY</b> one "00" substring</li> <li style="text-align: justify;">For case $$$4$$$, the string already contains exactly one "00" substring, so there is no need to perform any operation.</li>  
</ul>
