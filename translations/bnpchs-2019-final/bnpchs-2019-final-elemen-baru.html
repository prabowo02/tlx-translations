  <h3>Description</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	After years of research, Feli finally discovered a new element.
	She names this element Jolibi.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	The Jolibi element has a unique characteristic. 
	Every Jolibi element has a constant speed with 
	a direction that may not be the same for other Jolibi elements.
	In addition, a Jolibi element can penetrate 
	other elements, including other Jolibi elements.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Feli becomes more well known because Jolibi 
	is known to produce energy easily. 
	For every pair of Jolibi elements that have 
	a maximum distance of R units, they will produce an energy. 
	If a pair of Jolibi elements have a distance of 
	more than R units, then the energy produced will disappear.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	To get that energy, Feli made a device called 
	Jolly that can capture all the energy produced by Jolibi. 
	However, Jolly can only be operated once and anytime. 
	After Jolly is turned on, it will directly capture 
	the produced energy and automaticly turns off afterwards.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	In the 0th second, Feli observed that there are $$$N$$$ Jolibi elements 
	with a position and direction that can be represented in two dimensions. 
	Feli wants to use Jolly as effective as possible. As Feli's assistant, 
	you are asked to determine the maximum amount of energy that can be captured using Jolly. Help Feli!
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	The first line contains 2 positive integers $$$N$$$ and $$$R$$$ 
	where $$$N$$$ represents the number of Jolibi elements observed by Feli 
	and $$$R$$$ represents the maximum distance 
	such that Jolibi elements can produce energy. 
	The next $$$N$$$ lines containt 4 integers $$$x, y, dx, dy$$$ 
	where pairs x and y represents the initial position of an element 
	and pairs dx and dy represents the direction vector of the element.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Output an integer that shows the maximum energy that can be obtained.
