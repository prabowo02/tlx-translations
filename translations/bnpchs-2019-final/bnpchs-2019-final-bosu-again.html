<h3>Description</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Three weeks have passed since Jeli successfully challenged Feli to study. Feli, who has been continuously studying for the last 3 weeks, now challenges Jeli to answer the same question.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For those of you who have forgotten about Bosu, Bosu is a rhythm game. In Bosu, triangles appear, and they have to be clicked in time. For every successful triangle click, your combo will be increased by 1 and your score will be increased by your current combo number. For example, your score is currently 10 and your combo is currently 4. If you then successfully clicked a triangle, your combo will be 5, and your score will be 15. At the start of the game, both your combo and score are 0.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  "Three weeks ago, you successfully determined my final score in Bosu by just the number of triangles in the game.", Feli said to Jeli.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  "Yes, and that made you study, didn't it?", Jeli replied.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  "Now, I will challenge you again with the same question!", Feli challenged.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  "What is my final score if there are $$$N$$$ triangles and I successfully clicked all of them in time?", Feli continues.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Jeli is surprised and immediately requests for your assistance. Help Jeli answer the question!
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Input starts with an integer $$$T$$$ — the number of test cases. The next $$$T$$$ lines describe a test case.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Each test case is an integer $$$N$$$ — the amount of triangles given by Feli.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>
