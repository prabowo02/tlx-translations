<!-- Title : Learning to Count -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  Pak Chanek is a math teacher. Today, he is teaching $N$ students to count. Sequentially from the first student, Pak Chanek will give the $i$-th student 
  an interval of numbers $[L_i, R_i]$. The student will then take turns (from the first student to the $N$-th student) to mention 
  all numbers on the interval $[L_i, R_i]$ that has not been mentioned by a previous student. For example, say the first student
  gets interval $[2, 5]$. Then, if the second student gets interval $[1, 6]$, they will only mention $1$ and $6$,
  because all numbers from $2$ to $5$ have been mentioned by the first student.
</p>

<p>
  After all of Pak Chanek's students have mentioned the numbers, 
  Pak Chanek wonders what is the sum of all the numbers that his students mentioned.
  Help Pak Chanek satisfy his curiosity!
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p>
  The first line consists of a single integer $N$ — the number of Pak Chanek's students.
</p>

<p>
  The next $N$ lines contain two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ — the interval that the $i$-th student receives from Pak Chanek.
</p>


<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p>
  An integer, the sum of all numbers that Pak Chanek's students mentioned.
