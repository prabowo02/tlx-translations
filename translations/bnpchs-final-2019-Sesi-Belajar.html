<!-- Title: Study Session-->
<h3>Description</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Feli is a college student who recently took a part-time job as a teacher. In this part-time job, Feli is tasked to teach and improve the grade of $$$N$$$ students. Initially, the $$$i$$$-th student has an academic grade of $$$X_i$$$. To finish her assignment, Feli must make the final academic grade of each student to exactly $$$M$$$.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In a single study session, Feli can teach multiple students at once, and every student who attends the session gets it's academic grade increases by one. If the grade of a student reached $$$M$$$, then the student feels that they has mastered the lesson and will not attend the study session again. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The friendship of the $$$N$$$ students is very close. If in a study session, the $$$L$$$-th student and $$$R$$$-th student attend the session, then every student between $$$L$$$ and $$$R$$$ must come too. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Help Feli by telling her the minimum study session needed to finish the task, so that she can return to her vacation as soon as possible.
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Input starts with a single integer $$$T$$$, the number of test cases. The next lines contain the description of each test case as explained below.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The first line of each description contains 2 positive integers $$$N$$$ and $$$M$$$, where $$$N$$$ is the number of students in a study session and $$$M$$$ is the grade every student must reach.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The second line contains $$$N$$$ integers $$$X_i$$$, where $$$X_i$$$ is the initial grade of the $$$i$$$-th student.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For each test case, output "Case #$$$X$$$: $$$Y$$$", where $$$X$$$ is the case number (starting from 1), and $$$Y$$$ is the minimum study session needed to finish Feli's task.
</p>
