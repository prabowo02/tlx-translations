<h3>Description</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Chairoikoguma (otherwise known as Koguma) is a bear that loves honey very much. One time in the honey forest, while wandering around peacefully, Koguma found the 
  location of the tastiest honey in the world. Koguma wants to stay as long as possible while eating the honey.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Unfavorably, Jelix, the owner of the honey forest, despises that his honey is taken. The forest is populated by bees. As soon as Jelix notices Koguma 
  approaching the honey, he sends the bees from the hives to strike Koguma. Koguma wants to eat honey as long as possible, but he hates bee sting. Therefore after Koguma 
  eats the honey for maximum possible time, he will go home safely.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The honey forest can be illustrated as a $N \times N$ meters grid. There are symbols as follow:
  <ul>
  <li>The symbol <code>K</code> represents the initial position of Koguma,</li>
  <li>The symbol <code>.</code> represents an empty field, </li>
  <li>The symbol <code>#</code> represents a woods that can be passed by neither Koguma nor the bees,</li>
  <li>The symbol <code>@</code> represents Koguma's house, </li>
  <li>The symbol <code>H</code> represents a beehive. There can be more than one beehives in the forest.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>Koguma's Movements</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In one second, Koguma can move <b>at most</b> $S$ steps in four directions: left, right, up, or down. These steps do not necessarily have the same direction. For 
  example if $S = 3$, then in one second Koguma can move with these direction: left-right-up, left-up, up, right-right-right, and so on.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Koguma cannot pass a woods (#), and he can immediately get into his house as soon as he reaches his house (@). Furthermore, Koguma cannot pass a field that contains 
  bee colony (further explanation in the next section) because he will get stung immediately. 
</p>

<h4>Bees Movement</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Bees move as a colony, each colony's movement is as follow:
  <ul>
    <li>
      In one second, each colony can split itself into at most four new colonies that move into the field to the left, right, up, or down of its current field. The 
      field, where the colony was in, is still populated by the old colony. They remain in place but at the same time move to four directions. Bees only move in the integer 
      second.
    </li>
    <li>
      Formally, if a colony resides in field $(r, c)$ at second $t$, then from second $t$ until $t + 0.999 \dots$ the colony will stay in field $(r, c)$. 
      At second $t + 1$, the fields $(r, c)$, $(r, c + 1)$, $(r, c - 1)$, $(r + 1, c)$, and $(r - 1, c)$ will be populated by bee colonies.
    <li>
      The bee colony can pass neither Koguma's house nor a woods. The bees consider Koguma's house as a tree.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>The Task</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  You have been requested to help Koguma specify the <b>maximum</b> time (in seconds) he can enjoy the honey in his initial position and goes home safely without any bee 
  sting.
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Input starts with a single integer $T (1 \leq T \leq 100)$, where $T$ is the number of test cases. <br>
  Each test case begins with 2 integers $N$ $(1 \leq N \leq 800)$ and $S$ $(1 \leq S \leq 1000)$. <br>
  The next $N$ lines contain $N$ characters that represent the grid of honey forest. <br>
  It is guaranteed that there is exactly one character <code>K</code> and one character <code>@</code> in the grid, and every bee can reach Koguma's starting position.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For each test case, output <code>Kasus #$X$: $Y$</code>, where $X$ is the case number starting from 1, 
  and $Y$ is an integer representing the maximum time (in seconds) Koguma can enjoy the honey. If it is impossible for Koguma to reach his house, output <code>-1</code> instead.
