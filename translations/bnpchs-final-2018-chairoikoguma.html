<h3>Description</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Chairoikoguma (otherwise known as Koguma) is a bear that loves honey a lot. At one time in the honey forest, while wandering around peacefully, Koguma found the 
  location of the tastiest honey in the world. Koguma wants to stay as long as possible while eating honey.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Unfavorably, Jelix, the landlord of the honey forest, despises the honey snatching. The forest populates bees. As soon as Jelix notices Koguma 
  approaching the honey, he sends the bees from the hives to strike Koguma. Koguma wants to eat honey as long as possible, but he hates bee sting. Therefore Koguma eats 
  honey for maximum possible time, then goes home safely.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The honey forest can be illustrated as $N \times N$ meters grid. With symbols as follow:
  <ul>
  <li>The symbol <code>K</code> represents the initial position of Koguma,</li>
  <li>The symbol <code>.</code> represents an empty field, </li>
  <li>The symbol <code>#</code> represents a woods that can be passed by neither of Koguma nor the bees,</li>
  <li>The symbol <code>@</code> represents Koguma's house, </li>
  <li>The symbol <code>H</code> represents a beehive. There can be more than one beehive in the forest.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>Koguma Movements</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In one second, Koguma can move <b>at most</b> $S$ steps in four directions: left, right, up and down. Each step could has different direction. For example if 
  $S = 3$, then in 1 second Koguma can move with such direction: left-right-top, left-top, top, right-right-right, and so on.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Koguma cannot pass a woods (#), and he can immediately get into his house as soon as he reaches his house (@). Furthermore, Koguma cannot pass a field that contains 
  bee colony (further explanation in the next section) because he will get stung immediately. 
</p>

<h4>Bees Movement</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Bees move as a colony, each colony move is as follow:
  <ul>
    <li>
      In one second, each colony can split itself into at most four new colonies that move into the field in the left, right, top, or down from the initial field. The 
      initial field still populates the old colony. They remain in place but also move to four directions continuously. Bees only move if the second is integer.
    </li>
    <li>
      Formally, if a colony reside in field $(r, c)$ at $t$ seconds, then from $t$ seconds until $t + 0.999\dots$ seconds the colony will stay in field $(r, c)$. 
      At $t + 1$ seconds fields $(r, c)$, $(r, c + 1)$, $(r, c - 1)$, $(r + 1, c)$, and $(r - 1, c)$ will populate the bee colony.  
    </li>
    <li>
      The bee colony can pass neither of Koguma's house nor a woods. The bees consider Koguma's house as a tree.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>The Task</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  You have been requested to help Koguma specify the maximum time he can enjoy the honey in his initial position and goes home safely without any bee sting.
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Input starts with a single integer $T (1 \leq T \leq 100)$, where $T$ is the number of test cases. <br>
  Each test cases begin with 2 integers $N$ $(1 \leq N \leq 800)$ and $S$ $(1 \leq S \leq 1000)$. <br>
  The next $N$ lines contain $N$ characters that represent the grid of honey forest. <br>
  It is guaranteed that there are exactly one character <code>K</code> and <code>@</code> in the grid, and there is a bee that can reach Koguma's starting position.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For each test case, output <code>Kasus #$X$: $Y$</code>, where $X$ is the case number starting from 1, 
  and $Y$ is an integer represent the maximum time (in second) Koguma can enjoy the honey. If it is impossible for Koguma to reach his house output <code>-1</code> instead.
