<!-- Title : Chaneka Multiplication -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  Chaneka, child of Pak Chanek, is currently doing some math homework. On that homework, each question
  is of the form "What is the result of $\frac{A \times B}{11}$?" for some given integers $A$ and $B$.
  It is guaranteed from the input that $A \times B$ is divisible by $11$.
</p>

<p>
  This homework is clearly an easy one. In 10 minutes, Chaneka was able to finish it. However, Chaneka
  is often hasty. Because of that, to verify Chaneka's answers, Chaneka asks you to create a program
  that could output the result of $\frac{A \times B}{11}$. Please help Chaneka!
