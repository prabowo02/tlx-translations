<!--adding many numbers-->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Jelix Fingga is a math lecturer at the Panda University. One day, Jelix Fingga gives his students numbers from $$$A$$$ to $$$B$$$ inclusive. He asks them to count the sum of the numbers from $$$A$$$ to $$$B$$$.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
  However, most of his students could not answer this question because the result can be very large. Seeing that, Jelix Fingga changed the question from counting the sum of these numbers to deciding whether the sum of the numbers from $$$A$$$ to $$$B$$$ is negative, positive, or zero.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
  Maxi, one of Jelix Fingga's students, still cannot answer the second question and asks you, as his best friend, to help him. Help Maxi answer the question.
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify">
  The first line consists of an integer $$$T$$$ which denotes the number of cases. The next $$$T$$$ lines consists of two integers $$$A$$$ and $$$B$$$ according to the description.
</p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For every case, output "Kasus #$$$X$$$: $$$Y$$$" without quotation marks, where $$$X$$$ denotes the case number starting from one and $$$Y$$$ denotes the answer for that case. Output:
  <ul>
    <li>"Positif" without quotation marks if the answer is positive.</li>
    <li>"Negatif" without quotation marks if the answer is negative.</li>
    <li>"Nol" without quotation marks if the answer is zero.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
  <li style="text-align: justify;">$$$1 &le;T &le; 100$$$.</li>
  <li style="text-align: justify;">$$$-2^{63} + 1 &le;A &le; B &le;2^{63} + 1$$$.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sample Input 1</h3>

<pre>
3
-5 6
-5 2
-1 1
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output 1</h3>

<pre>
Kasus #1: Positif
Kasus #2: Negatif
Kasus #3: Nol
</pre>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For the first case, the sum of integers from -5 to 6 is 6. Because 6 is positive, then output "Positif".
