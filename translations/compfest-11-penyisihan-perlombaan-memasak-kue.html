<!-- Title : Cake Baking Competition -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  In the ACM (Annual Cake Mashups) cake baking competition, there are $N$ contestants.
  Each contestant has baked a cake and those cakes will be graded by the judges.
  There are two aspects that affects the value of a cake, its delicacy value and its elegance value.
  The $i$-th cake has delicacy value $L_i$ and elegance value $C_i$. 
  All pairs $(L_i, C_i)$ are distinct.
</p>

<p>
  The grading system is as follows. There are $M$ judges that will grade the cakes.
  The $j$-th judge will choose two non-negative integers $A_j$ and $B_j$.
  All pairs $(A_j, B_j)$ are distinct.
  The value of the $i$-th cake according to the $j$-th judge is $A_j \times L_i + B_j \times C_i$.
  After the $j$-th judge has graded all cakes, they will select the cake with the highest value according to them as their champion.
  Note that if there are multiple cakes that satisfy the condition, all of them are selected as champions. 
</p>

<p>
  Clearly, this is a very complicated system. However, that isn't important.
  The question is "For each cake, how many judges selected that cake as their champion?"
</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p>
  The first line consists of two integers $M$ and $N$ — the number of judges and contestants
  in the cake baking competition.
</p>

<p>
  The next $M$ lines contain two integers $A_j$ and $B_j$ — the grading constants selected by the $j$-th judge.
</p>

<p>
  The next $N$ lines contain two integers $L_i$ and $C_i$ — the delicacy value and elegance value
  of the cake baked by the $i$-th contestant.
</p>


<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p>
  There are $N$ lines. The $i$-th line contains the number of judges that selected cake $i$ as their champion.
</p>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p>
    According to judge $1$:
    <ul>
        <li>Cake $1$ has value $2 \times 4 + 2 \times 5 = 18$</li>
        <li>Cake $2$ has value $2 \times 3 + 2 \times 6 = 18$</li>
        <li>Cake $2$ has value $2 \times 1 + 2 \times 7 = 16$</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    The highest value is reached by cake $1$ and $2$, thus judge $1$ will choose both cake $1$
    and $2$ as their champion.
</p>

<p>
    According to judge $2$:
    <ul>
        <li>Cake $1$ has value $1 \times 4 + 4 \times 5 = 24$</li>
        <li>Cake $2$ has value $1 \times 3 + 4 \times 6 = 27$</li>
        <li>Cake $2$ has value $1 \times 1 + 4 \times 7 = 29$</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    The highest value is reached by cake $3$, thus judge $2$ will choose cake $3$ 
    as their champion.
